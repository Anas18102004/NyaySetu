# Google ADK Agent Integration

This document explains the integration of Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) with the NyaySetu chat system.

## Overview

The chat system has been updated to use Google ADK agents instead of the direct Google Generative AI implementation. This provides:

- **Better legal focus**: The agent is specifically trained for legal queries
- **Search capabilities**: Can search for accurate legal information
- **Improved response formatting**: Responses are formatted to look like ChatGPT/Gemini
- **Better error handling**: Robust error handling for various scenarios

## Key Changes

### 1. Updated `chat.py`

- Replaced direct Google Generative AI with Google ADK agent
- Added response formatting function `format_response_like_chatgpt()`
- Added robust response extraction function `extract_response_text()`
- Improved error handling for various failure scenarios

### 2. Updated `core_agent/agent.py`

- Configured agent with proper Google API key
- Enhanced instructions for legal focus
- Added response formatting guidelines
- Improved prompt engineering for better legal responses

### 3. Response Formatting

The system now formats responses to look more like ChatGPT/Gemini:

- **Bold formatting** for legal terms (Section, Article, Act, etc.)
- **Proper bullet points** for lists
- **Clear spacing** between paragraphs
- **Professional tone** with friendly introductions

## Features

### Legal Focus
- Only responds to law-related questions
- Rejects non-legal queries with appropriate redirection
- Uses search tools to find accurate legal information

### Response Formatting
- Formats legal sections in **bold**
- Uses bullet points for lists
- Maintains professional yet approachable tone
- Adds context when explaining legal concepts

### Error Handling
- Handles API timeouts gracefully
- Provides fallback responses for various error scenarios
- Maintains user experience even when services are unavailable

## Usage

### For Users
The chat interface remains the same. Users can ask legal questions and receive formatted responses.

### For Developers
```python
from chat import chat_with_law_agent

# Simple usage
response = await chat_with_law_agent("What is Section 420 of IPC?")

# With session management
response = await chat_with_law_agent("How can I file an FIR?", session_id="user123")
```

## Testing

Run the integration test to verify everything works:

```bash
cd backend
python test_agent_integration.py
```

This will test:
- Simple greetings
- Legal questions
- Non-legal questions (should be rejected)
- Error handling

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google API key for Gemini access

### Agent Configuration
The agent is configured in `core_agent/agent.py` with:
- Model: `gemini-2.0-flash`
- Tools: Google Search
- Focus: Legal queries only

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure `google-adk>=1.7.0` is installed
   - Check Python path includes backend directory

2. **API Key Issues**
   - Verify `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable is set
   - Check API key permissions and quotas

3. **Response Formatting Issues**
   - Check the `format_response_like_chatgpt()` function
   - Verify markdown rendering in frontend

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting the log level in your application:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add conversation memory for better context
- Implement document analysis capabilities
- Add voice response generation
- Enhance search capabilities with legal databases
